## The effect vocabulary (normative · closed)

An **effect** is a class of interaction with the world outside the run.
The v1 vocabulary is exactly the capability surface of
[01 §permits](./01-envelope.md#permits--optional--the-declared-capability-boundary)
— **five categories** (this table is the one vocabulary the checker, the
inference, the certificate, and `policy:` rules all speak — one voice,
never a parallel list):

| Effect category | Carried by | Granted by |
|---|---|---|
| `fs` (read · write) | `nika:read` · `nika:grep` · `nika:write` · `nika:edit` · file-writing media builtins | `permits.fs.read` / `permits.fs.write` (path globs) |
| `net` | `nika:fetch` · `nika:notify` (webhook) · any URL-reaching builtin | `permits.net.http` (host allowlist · SSRF floor beneath) |
| `exec` | the `exec:` verb | `permits.exec` (`false` · `true` · program allowlist) |
| `tools` | the `invoke:` verb surface | `permits.tools` (id globs) |
| `env` | the names a child process inherits — composed, never inherited (see [01 §permits](./01-envelope.md#permits--optional--the-declared-capability-boundary)) | `permits.env` (exact names · **never inferred**: a subprocess's environment reads are opaque) |

> **Why this table said `four` until 2026-08-11 (D-2026-08-11-N22).** `permits.env`
> has shipped in the envelope since the block existed, `NIKA-AUTH-007` counts its
> entries among the bounds (NEP-0005), and [02 §exec](./02-verbs.md) reaches a
> child's environment *only through a declared `permits.env:` name*. The table
> that calls itself **one voice, never a parallel list** did not know the key —
> so the spec carried exactly the parallel list it forbids. Admitting `env` is
> **not adding a category, it is documenting one that ships**: a category with no
> key would change the language; a key with no category made four downstream
> surfaces (inference · certificate · `policy:` `<effect-class>` · `NIKA-SEC-004`)
> unable to name it.

Two derived facts the engine computes and no author writes:

- **A task's required effects** — from its verb and its arguments (the
  builtin classification table is normative for the stdlib: each
  catalog entry declares which category it carries and which argument
  names its target). `infer:` with no tools is **pure compute**: zero
  required effects (provider egress is governed by the secrets flow
  rules, not by a capability category).
- **The workflow's needed boundary** — the union of its tasks' required
  effects, as a `permits:` block (`nika check --infer-permits` prints
  it; the round-trip law holds: the inferred block re-checks clean).

**Required ⊆ permitted is judged twice** (per 01 §permits): statically
at `nika check` (an escape = refusal before any token) and at run time
(`NIKA-SEC-004` — the dynamic cases a static check cannot see).

## The `policy:` block · *optional · named workflow law*

`permits:` bounds capability; nothing bounded **order and shape** — «
no shell after an untrusted fetch », « a human signs before anything
irreversible », « only these providers » were checkable only by eyeball.
`policy:` names those laws next to the workflow:

```yaml
policy:
  require:
    human_gate_before: [exec, write]   # these effect classes sit behind a human
  forbid:
    exec_after: [net]                  # order law · no shell downstream of the network
  allow:
    providers: [ollama, mistral]       # infer/agent provider allowlist
  limits:
    max_tasks: 50                      # workflow-shape bound
  prefer:                              # SOFT · recorded, never judged (v1)
    providers: [ollama]
  optimize: cost                       # SOFT · recorded, never judged (v1)
  endorsement: solo                    # HARD · the named solo mode (NEP-0014)
```

**Grammar (normative · closed at every level).** `policy:` is a mapping
of up to seven **families**. Unknown families and unknown rule names are
refusals (`NIKA-PARSE`-class): the rule set is closed per minor —
patterns are named after the incidents they prevent, raw temporal logic
is never exposed.

| Family | Nature | v1 rules (closed) |
|---|---|---|
| `require:` | **hard** · judged at check | `human_gate_before: [<effect-class>…]` |
| `forbid:` | **hard** · judged at check | `exec_after: [<effect-class>…]` |
| `allow:` | **hard** · judged at check | `providers: [<provider>…]` |
| `limits:` | **hard** · judged at check | `max_tasks: <positive integer>` |
| `endorsement:` | **hard** · judged at check | `solo` — the NAMED solo mode: exactly one endorser (one human gate), its fresh authorization bound to the action and logged as such · a gate under no declared mode refuses (`NIKA-SEC-013` · fail-closed) · a declared solo with more than one gate refuses as the declaration lying (NEP-0014 · F-P23) |
| `prefer:` | **soft** · parsed, recorded, NOT judged | `providers: [<provider>…]` (ordered) |

> ⚠️ **`endorsement:` names a family and has one member, and the gap is a
> capability gap, not a naming one** (stated 2026-08-11). A workflow that wants
> **two** human gates on one action is **inexpressible** — not because two
> endorsers are unsafe, but because the enum has a single value. The honest
> reading is that the language today can say *one human authorised this* and
> cannot say *two did*, and a reader deserves to know which of the two it is.
> **The single member is not the defect and MUST NOT be removed**: `solo`

> wearing more than one gate). Deleting a working refusal to make a table
> shorter is subtraction, not simplification. The member that is missing is

> semantics are decided.
| `optimize:` | **soft** · parsed, recorded, NOT judged | `cost` \| `latency` \| `quality` |

`<effect-class>` is the closed set `exec · write · net · tools` — the
effect vocabulary above with `fs` split at its grain of harm (`write`;
reads are not gateable in v1) **and `env` deliberately absent: a policy
rule over environment names is a separate decision this spec has not
taken, and naming it here without the semantics would be a rule that
cannot be judged** (see the soft-family law in the next sentence, which
this set must not violate). The gap is stated rather than closed
silently, because the table above is the one vocabulary and a reader is
owed the reason a member of it is missing from this derived set.
Soft families are **inert by design** in
v1: the solver that would satisfy them is research surface, and a
constraint that cannot be judged must never look judged — the check
records them (a hint names them as recorded-not-judged) and nothing
else.

**Semantics of the hard rules (normative · statically decided on the
graph — the same derived graph every judge reads, [03](./03-dag.md))** ·

- `require.human_gate_before: [C…]` — every task carrying an effect of
  a listed class has, among its ancestors (data ∪ control edges), a
  **human gate**: an `invoke:` of `nika:prompt`. The pause is the
  consent (exit 4 · resume with the answer · [02](./02-verbs.md)).
- `forbid.exec_after: [C…]` — no `exec:` task is a descendant of a task
  carrying an effect of a listed class. The order law reads the graph,
  not the schedule: any path counts, `after:` edges included.
- `allow.providers: [P…]` — every `infer:`/`agent:` task's provider
  (the segment of `model:` before `/`, or the run's default model when
  the task names none) is in the list. A provider that cannot be
  determined statically (a templated `model:`) is a violation under a
  declared allowlist — **fail-closed**, pin the literal (same doctrine
  as the permits argv rule: judge the shape you can actually verify).
- `limits.max_tasks: N` — the workflow declares at most N tasks.

**The approval is a bounded ticket (normative · NEP-0013)** · the
consent the pause collects is not a bare answer: it is a **ticket**
· (1) **content-bound** — the ticket binds the hash of the canonical
rendering of what is shown (the message · the gated action's identity ·
the effect classes in play · never an LLM summary); an answer whose
resolved content hash differs halts (`approval.content_mismatch` at the
receipt) · (2) **scoped and TTL'd** — this run × this step × this
content hash, with a bounded TTL; an expired ticket re-prompts, a
cross-run replay is refused · (3) **rate-limited** — at most N=5
approvals per run; identical prompts dedup (the same content hash rides
one ticket, attested `dedup`); a heterogeneous batch is refused at
check (one prompt gates one action of one class); the N+1th prompt is a
typed HALT (`NIKA-SEC-010` · `security_error`), never a queue · (4) **attested** — every
decision emits a hash-chained `approval_decided` event (ticket digest ·
shown hash · decision · remaining TTL · scope), and the digests rise to
the receipt · (5) **revocable before execution only** — never after:
the receipt shows what executed under which authority.

**A violation is `NIKA-POLICY-001`** (`security_error` · check-time ·
before any token). The diagnostic names the rule, the offending task,and the witness — for order rules, the path (`fetch_page → summarize →
deploy`); for gate rules, the missing ancestor; for provider rules, the
offending literal. Policy violations are never fed back to an `agent:`
model: organizational law is not negotiation material.

**Composition** · `policy:` and `permits:` are orthogonal judges over
one body: permits answers *may this task touch X at all*, policy
answers *may it do so here, in this order, unattended*. A body must
satisfy **both**. (`allow.providers` deliberately covers the one
authority `permits:` does not — the provider surface; capability stays
permits' ground, and no policy rule re-spells a permits grant.)

## The affirmative-consent law · *normative · NEP-0020*

A REFUSED confirm-mode `nika:prompt` settles the task **success with
value `false`** — the Deny lives in the approval attestation
(NEP-0013), never in the task status. So a gate that nothing consumes
is a rubber stamp: a bare `after: { ask: success }` edge admits the
refusal, a `when:` that never reads the answer lets it through, and a
`when:` provably true on `false`
(`with.go == true || with.go == false`) blocks nothing. The law: for
every confirm-mode gate (`mode:` absent or the literal `confirm`) and
every egress-capable task (`exec:` · a net or fs-**write** builtin ·
`mcp:*` · an `agent:` whose whitelist admits an egress tool), judged on
the derived graph, **every route from the gate to the task must be
closed** — by an affirmative gate, by `when: false`, or by a closer
confirm gate (the nearest gate owns its closure). **`false` triggers
exactly zero effects.**

**The affirmative gate (normative · the decidable fragment).** A `when:`
is affirmative when it evaluates to FALSE under the **refusal
substitution**: `tasks.<gate>.output` → `false` · `tasks.<gate>.status`
→ `"success"` (a refusal settles success — a status read is NOT
consent, and it is decidable exactly), the exact single-island `with:`
binding carrying its target's value, Kleene-3 over the fragment
(boolean literals · `==`/`!=`/`in` on resolved literals · `!`/`&&`/`||`
/ternary). Three verdicts, three fates —

- **FALSE** — the route is closed (the human-gated-ship pattern:
  `with: { go: "${{ tasks.ask.output }}" }` + `when: ${{ with.go == true }}`).
- **TRUE** — the gate is PROVEN open under the refusal; the route stands.
- **Unknown** — the gate cannot be decided statically (a nested template
  binding · an expression beyond the fragment): the defect is unproven,
  and an unproven defect is the advisory hint's ground, **never** a
  refusal (sound — no false red).

A violation is **`NIKA-SEC-014`** (`security_error` · check-time ·
before any token) — the diagnostic names the gate AND the sink and
teaches the affirmative pattern. The law binds with or without a
`policy:` block (it is not a declared-rule violation, so it does not
speak `NIKA-POLICY-001`), and `mode: choice` is out of scope — its
answer is a string and the lane claims nothing there (silence, never
wrong).

## Secret flow refusals carry their codes (normative)

The flow rules themselves live in
[01 §egress](./01-envelope.md#egress--optional--sanctioned-destinations-declassification)
and are unchanged. This chapter names their wire codes — the two
refusal classes were report-only until W4:

| Code | Class | Witness (in the diagnostic) |
|---|---|---|
| `NIKA-SEC-006` | a `secrets.<name>` value reaches an **unsanctioned sink** (an `exec:` argument · an `invoke:` payload · an `infer:`/`agent:` prompt) | the **taint path**, source-first (`secrets.api_key → with.tok → tasks.call.output → exec`) + the exact `egress: [{ to: "<sink>" }]` clause that would sanction it |
| `NIKA-SEC-007` | a tainted value reaches the **workflow boundary** (`outputs:` — where a result leaves the run) | the taint path into the `outputs:` entry |

Both are `security_error`, check-time, blocking. The taint path is not
decoration: it is the **minimal witness** that lets an author decide
sanction-or-fix without re-deriving the flow by eye. The secret's
*value* never appears in any diagnostic.

## The permit-parameterization taint (normative)

The fit above proves `Required ⊆ Declared` on **categories**; it says
nothing about the resolved VALUES flowing under a present block. Every
value carries an integrity label — **Integ ∈ {trusted, untrusted}** —
orthogonal to Conf (the secrets axis): literals, `const.*`, and
`secrets.*` are trusted; `inputs.*` (caller-supplied at launch),
`config.*` (deployment-supplied, outside the file), fetch/tool results,
and anything derived from them are untrusted, with monotone propagation
(one untrusted operand taints the whole interpolation). Two rules bind
untrusted values under a `permits:` block (NEP-0004 · LAW-AUTH-0325):

| Code | Class | Witness (in the diagnostic) |
|---|---|---|
| `NIKA-AUTH-007` | an interpolation reaches a **permit bound** (a host, glob, program, or env-name literal inside `permits:` · NEP-0005 counts `env:` entries among the bounds) | the bound's own path (`net.http[0]`) — a bound MUST be a literal: the boundary would be self-serve, there is nothing left to canonicalize against |
| `NIKA-AUTH-008` | an untrusted value reaches a permitted verb's **argument** and its canonical resolved form escapes the step's permit | the **taint path**, source-first (`inputs.p → args.path`) + the resolved value, its canonical form, and the bound it escaped |

Both are `security_error`, check-time, blocking. The **re-gate** never
matches raw strings: the engine canonicalizes the RESOLVED value first,
per plane — fs paths are lexically normalized (`.`/`..` resolved,
separators collapsed) before the glob match, net hosts are lowercased
(IDNA→punycode, trailing dot and default port stripped), and for exec
argv the program is argv[0] while re-entry-class tokens (`--exec`, `-c`,
`eval`…) are never covered unless the permit lists them explicitly.
`datasets/../datasets/q3.csv` is INSIDE `datasets/**`;
`../../etc/passwd` is not — a prefix matcher cannot tell them apart,
the canonical form can.

An untrusted value not resolvable at check (no default) **defers**: the
file stays valid, the run-time re-gate is mandatory (an escape fails the
task `NIKA-SEC-004` — the defense-in-depth twin of NEP-0003 law 3), and
the check report SHOULD list the deferred re-gates informationally so CI
sees the attack surface before launch.

The only door is the authored one — a `lift:` entry naming the **taint**
law (see [§the authored doors](#the-authored-doors-normative) for the
construct):

```yaml
tasks:
  load:
    invoke:
      tool: nika:read
      args: { path: "${{ inputs.p }}" }
    lift:
      - law: taint
        from: inputs.p            # one binding
        because: "vendor inventory path, deployment-controlled, reviewed at release time"
```

A `law: taint` entry MUST name `from:` (one binding) and a non-empty
`because:`; the receipt records it (taint path · because · value
digest). It lifts the TAINT law only — the value is then matched like a
literal and must still sit inside the declared boundary. It is never a
permit bypass, and there is no implicit declassification in v1.

## The data-as-code sink (normative · NEP-0006 · LAW-AUTH-0327)

The contract distinguishes an INERT read from a CODE-BEARING read.
Some artifact classes execute at load: the serialized-executable
family (the deserializer runs code · `.pkl` `.pickle` `.dill`
`.joblib` `.pt` `.pth` `.ckpt`), scripts and notebooks (`.py` `.sh`
`.bash` `.zsh` `.ps1` `.bat` `.cmd` `.rb` `.pl` `.php` `.js` `.mjs`
`.ipynb`), and executable binaries/modules (`.exe` `.dll` `.so`
`.dylib` `.wasm` `.jar`). The three classes are CLOSED and normative
(only a NEP amends them · the deliberate exclusions and their reasons
live in NEP-0006). A `nika:fetch` whose RESOLVED URL path names one ·
matched case-insensitively on the path's final extension, the query
carries no verdict · is refused at check (`NIKA-SEC-008` ·
security_error · the diagnostic names the class and both repairs) when
the URL is literal or resolvable through the taint rules above; the
unresolvable DEFERS to the run-time twin (`NIKA-SEC-004` · the same
class refused on the resolved URL · defense in depth). The honest door
is a `lift:` entry naming the **data-as-code** law (non-empty `because:`
· greppable): it lifts THIS law only · never the `net.http` boundary,
never the SSRF floor, never the taint re-gate. The repair in the other
direction is to model the acquisition as the `exec` it feeds, under a
program permit review can see.

```yaml
    lift:
      - law: data-as-code
        because: "vendor checkpoint archived to cold storage, never loaded"
```

## The authored doors (normative)

`lift:` is the **single** construct through which an author opens a
named law. There is no second spelling, and there will not be one when a
third law earns a door.

```yaml
lift:
  - law: taint                    # REQUIRES from:
    from: inputs.p
    because: "<why this is safe, in words a reviewer can judge>"
  - law: data-as-code             # from: is FORBIDDEN here
    because: "<why this artifact is never loaded>"
```

The contract, for every entry ·

1. **`law:` is a closed enum.** v1 knows `taint` and `data-as-code`. A
   law that has no door cannot be lifted at all — that is the default,
   and it is the common case: **24 error-bearing laws exist; 2 have a
   door.**
2. **`because:` is mandatory and non-empty.** A lift with no reason is a
   parse error, not a warning. The reason is what review reads.
3. **A lift moves exactly ONE law.** It never widens `permits:`, never
   touches the `net.http` boundary, never lowers the SSRF floor.
4. **Every lift is recorded** in the run receipt and projected in the
   check certificate. A lift that review cannot see would defeat its own
   purpose.
5. **`from:` is law-specific** — required by `taint`, forbidden
   elsewhere. The schema enforces the discrimination; a `from:` on the
   wrong law is a parse error.

**Why one construct and not one field per law.** A door per law grows
the language linearly in laws, and each language feature an author uses
carries a measured **+18.9% odds of workflow failure** across 260K
workflows (see [08 §antivalues](./08-out-of-scope.md)). The provider is
a parameter of `infer:`, not a verb; the law is a parameter of `lift:`,
not a field. The predecessors — a task-level `declassify:` list and a
task-level `inert: "<because>"` string — are **dead**: same job, two
spellings, and the third law would have made three.

## The certificate names its effects (normative)

`nika check --json` already emits a resource certificate
([05](./05-errors.md) · attempts · llm calls · effect calls · spend).
W4 adds the **authority projection** — `certificate.effects`:

```json
{
  "effects": {
    "boundary_declared": true,
    "needed": { "fs": { "read": ["./data/**"] }, "exec": ["git"] },
    "escapes": 0
  }
}
```

`needed` is the inferred boundary (the same object `--infer-permits`
prints) · `boundary_declared` says whether the file carries a
`permits:` block · `escapes` is the count of required-outside-permitted
violations (0 in any clean report — the field exists so a certificate
consumer never has to re-derive it). The certificate stays a
projection: the judge is the check ladder, never the JSON.

## Errors (the `NIKA-POLICY` namespace · new in this chapter)

| Code | Category | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `NIKA-POLICY-001` | `security_error` | a hard `policy:` rule is violated (the diagnostic names rule + task + witness) |

`NIKA-SEC-006` / `NIKA-SEC-007` join the existing `NIKA-SEC` namespace
([05](./05-errors.md)); `NIKA-AUTH-007` / `NIKA-AUTH-008` join the
`NIKA-AUTH` namespace opened by NEP-0003's `NIKA-AUTH-006`;
`NIKA-SEC-013` (the endorsement mode) and `NIKA-SEC-014` (the
affirmative-consent law) join the same `NIKA-SEC` namespace.

## One obvious way (normative for linters)

- A capability boundary is spelled `permits:` — `policy.allow` never
  re-spells a permits grant (providers is the one allow rule, because
  permits has no provider category).
- A human gate is `invoke: { tool: "nika:prompt" }` — the pause IS the
  consent mechanism; a `when:` on a `config` flag is not a gate.
- Soft families record intent (`prefer` · `optimize`) — an engine that
  cannot honor them MUST still accept them (they are never judged, so
  they can never refuse).

## What v1 deliberately does not do

- **No solver.** Soft constraints are recorded, not satisfied —
  Pareto/unsat-core surfaces are research (the constraint that cannot
  be judged must never look judged).
- **No runtime policy.** Every v1 rule is decidable at `nika check` on
  the graph; rules whose truth needs runtime data are out of scope,
  deliberately (the check stays the pre-token audit).
- **No new verbs, no `approve:`.** The human gate rides the existing
  `nika:prompt` pause; a dedicated approval surface (delegation ·
  quorum · `via:`) is future work with its own chapter.
- **No policy inheritance.** A file's law is the file's — composition
  across `invoke: workflow:` calls stays the callee's own policy (the
  ceiling algebra is reserved, unwired).
- **No memory category.** Recall is a **tool**, reached through `invoke:`
  like every other callable ([08 §H9](./08-out-of-scope.md) · today
  `mcp:memory-server/recall`, tomorrow the reserved `nika:connectome/*`
  group — same verb, zero workflow-shape change). It is therefore
  governed by `permits.tools`, and **never by an ambient implicit
  memory**: a recall a reader cannot see in the file does not exist.
  Whether a store-scoped grant deserves its own effect category — the
  `net` precedent, where `nika:fetch` is a tool and yet hosts need
  bounding — is an open question for a future proposal, not a v1 gap.
