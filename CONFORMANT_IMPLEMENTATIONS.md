# Conformant implementations

> Registry of engines that pass the [conformance suite](conformance/runner-protocol.md).
> A row is added (or upgraded) only with a verifiable run of the suite at a
> pinned spec commit · per [spec/07-conformance.md](spec/07-conformance.md)

## How to be listed

1. Run the suite against your engine ·
   `<engine> conformance run conformance/tests/<level>` (or validate each
   fixture per the [runner protocol](conformance/runner-protocol.md)).
2. Open a PR on [supernovae-st/nika-spec](https://github.com/supernovae-st/nika-spec)
   adding a row · include the spec commit you ran against and a reproducible
   command or CI link.
3. Levels are claimed independently · `Core` alone is a valid claim.
